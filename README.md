## Intro
This repo is implementation of pretrained cartoonization model 'StyleCariGAN'

## Steps to run
1. Download Cartoonization.ipynb and open in colab.
2. Copy shared drive folder from in your drive.
3. Connect colab with drive.
4. Connect to A100 colab runtime (for training) or T4 (for testing).
5. Executes cells in Cartoonization.ipynb one by one. Donot restart session if it asks.
7. Remember to upload image in ip_img folder before running test.py
8. After running test.py output will be stored in op_img folder.
9. Remember to replace content of cpp_extension.py with file shared on drive.
10. Cross check file paths of files on drive before running.
11. After running train.py loss graph image will be stored in /content folder in colab.
